If you are unable to pull them cleanly, make sure to CC at least one archer once to limit the incoming damage your group will be taking. Also, beware of any patrolling elites that might aggro after the pull. Aside from that, this fight is a simple tank-and-spank as Rhahk'Zor is little more than a pseudo-boss and warmup for the dungeon.",

The only problem is that he is surrounded by numerous Defias Miner. However, they are non-elites with small health pools. Try to pick as many of them off as possible before pulling Johnson. I recommend that if you happen to have a hybrid DPS class in your group, have the hybrid also heal the tank when the  Pierce Armor debuff is up to guarantee the kill.",

Once the Shredder has been defeated, Sneed will hop out of the machine and continue the fight himself.

Make sure to CC the engineer as he may cast  Summon Remote-Controlled Golem, which summons a mechanical robot that is immune to most abilities. If the robot does get summoned, focus the engineer that summoned it as the robot will despawn once its summoner is dead. You can avoid this headache by simply CCing the add before the pull.",

These MUST be prioritized and dealt with before Smite, as when he reaches 66% and 33% hp respectively, he will cast  Smite Stomp which will stun everyone in part for nearly 10 seconds. If the Blackguards aren't killed or CC'ed effectively by this time, they will continue attacking your tank during the stun and wipe the group. The best way to deal with these guards is to mark one with a 'skull' and kill it, while a mage polymorphs the second. If you are the mage in the group, make sure to reapply the polymorph shortly before Smite hit's the 66% hp mark.\nOnce at 66% hp, Smite will stun the group and run towards his chest located at the base of the plank. From the chest, he will pull out a second weapon, activating his  Dual Wield ability. Not much will change during this phase aside from higher DPS coming out from Smite, so healers should be aware of that. You can cheese the encounter a bit by pulling Smite as far away from the chest as possible so that by the time he reaches the chest and returns to you; the stun duration will have already subsided.\nAt 33%, Smite will stun the group once again and run towards the chest. This time, he will pull out his famous 2-handed mace, granting him the  Smite Slam. If your tank gets stunned in the mace phase, make sure to throw extra heals on him and have DPS kite if they pull aggro. The most important part of this fight is dealing with the adds before the first stomp transition; the rest is a simple tank-and-spank. Like previous bosses in the dungeon, Mr. Smite is flanked by two mobs. However, the mob on HIS left can be pulled without engaging the boss, significantly reducing the difficulty of the fight. The other mob should be CC\'ed while the group focuses on the boss as he deals significant single-target damage and should be killed ASAP. Other than that, another tank-and-spank.",

	DUNGEON_BOSS_CAPTAIN_GREENSKIN_STRATEGY = "Like all add-based bosses, make sure to CC one of the adds next to Greenskin before the pull. I recommend that you CC the Defias Squallshaper as their frost nova ability can be quite annoying. Once you've engaged the boss, begin by killing the Defias Companion first as it is non-elite and will die quickly. After that, kill the remaining Defias Pirate and then swap to Greenskin while keeping your CC on the Squallshaper. Make sure to face Greenskin away from the group as his cleave can be quite nasty. When he dies, finish off the Squallshaper and loot his corpse.",

	DUNGEON_BOSS_EDWIN_VANCLEEF_STRATEGY = "When you engage Van Cleef, two Defias Blackguard will break stealth and attack you as well. Like Mr. Smite, make sure to deal with these mobs first. CC one and 'skull' mark the other and burn it down quickly, as Van Cleef does a tremendous amount of single-target damage and can shred your tank. Once both of the adds are dealt with, focus back on VC. Once he hits 50% health, he will summon 2 more adds for you to deal with. It remains quite heal-intensive so the healers and hybrids in your group should be on their toes and provide spot-healing as it is needed.",

	DUNGEON_BOSS_COOKIE_STRATEGY = "The most challenging part about Cookie is the leap off the ship to engage him. The bottom deck of the ship is packed with elites that can easily aggro if a jump is not timed correctly. Assuming you've timed the jump correctly, pull Cookie off the ship towards the exit of the dungeon. The fight is a simple tank-and-spank. Make sure to interrupt the  Cookie's Cooking spell as it heals Cookie for a fair chunk. The rest is easy.",

Dubbed the 'Wailing Caverns', these natural caves were filled with steam fissures which produced long, mournful wails as they vented. Naralex believed he could use the caverns' underground springs to restore lushness and fertility to the Barrens - but to do so would require siphoning the energies of the fabled Emerald Dream. Once connected to the Dream, however, the druid's vision somehow became a nightmare. Soon the Wailing Caverns began to change - the waters turned foul and the once-docile creatures inside metamorphosed into vicious, deadly predators. It is said that Naralex himself still resides somewhere inside the heart of the labyrinth, trapped beyond the edges of the Emerald Dream. Even his former acolytes have been corrupted by their master's waking nightmare - transformed into the wicked Druids of the Fang.",

He does, however, have a large amount of armor and base damage. If you have a melee-heavy group, this fight can drag on and be a slight nuisance for your healer, but nothing serious to worry.",

Like all of the druids, she has four abilities, 2 of which are shared by her contemporaries ( Lightning Bolt and  Sleep). Her most threatening ability is 'Sleep,' which can be applied to anyone in your party, including the Tank or Healer. To deal with this ability, make sure to interrupt it immediately. If you happen to pull another Druid of the Fang during the encounter, make sure to CC it right away as one 'Sleep' can be dealt with, but 2 or more will result in a wipe. If your interrupts are on point and you've pulled carefully, this fight should be easy.",

Prioritize these pythons before switching to Cobrahn. Like all of the Druids in the Wailing Caverns, Cobrahn may cast the dangerous 'Sleep' ability, which should be interrupted immediately. At some point during the encounter, Cobrahn will transform into a serpent, increasing his damage by 50 and attack speed by 43%. It's important that a 'Sleep' has not gone off on the healer during this phase. Otherwise, the tank will probably die. If the healer is not CC'ed during this phase, it's a guaranteed kill.",

	DUNGEON_BOSS_DEVIATE_FAERIE_DRAGON_STRATEGY = "The Deviate Faerie Dragon is a low armor, high damage mob that possesses no significant abilities. The challenge in this encounter comes from the fact that this is a 4-mob pull, all of which are elites. Two Druids of the Fang are also included in this pull, meaning that  Druid's Slumber is likely to go off in this fight. Your strategy should be to CC one of the Druids while burning the other one down and interrupting its 'Sleep' whenever possible. Your tank will be taking damage from 3 different elites here, so if you have any hybrid classes in your group aside from the healer, make sure that they weave in some support heals during their rotation. This fight will test your group's ability to focus down a single target, so if you're coordinated and all on the same page, it should be a breeze.",

Additionally, he is flanked by one additional Druid of the Fang and a Deviate Shambler. Make sure to CC the Druid and interrupt Pythas whenever he casts 'Sleep.'

This is a chain lightning-style spell that will strike three melee units if they are close together. Make sure your melee spread out around the boss to avoid the damage.

From there, the Disciple will summon Mutanus the Devourer, a level 22 Elite Murloc Boss, whose aim is to kill the Disciple. Players must protect the Disciple at all costs while remaining alive. If the Disciple is killed or the group wipes, the entire event will fail. The event cannot be repeated until the instance is reset and all Lords of the Fang are killed again.",

To escort him, will require you to clear out any remaining adds on the way to the rock, most of which should already be cleared by progressing through the dungeon. Once the Disciple reaches Naralex and begins his final ritual, waves of adds will approach the Disciple to kill him. Burn down the adds while keeping your AOE DPS alive. After the 2nd wave of adds, Mutanus will appear to kill your group and the Disciple. He is very challenging, as he possesses two forms of crowd control that can be used against your group. Additionally, his  Thundercrack ability does a massive amount of damage to nearby targets, making this fight a nightmare for your melee DPS. Mutanus is a group composition check - make sure to have a healthy set of ranged DPS and at least one hybrid healing class aside from your main healer to assist with the thunderclap damage. There are no special tricks for this fight - stay at max range while healing up the group and try to stay alive. This fight is worth the trouble, as the loot is quite good.",

Arugal's summoning brought the ravenous worgen into the world of Azeroth. The feral wolf-men slaughtered not only the Scourge, but quickly turned on the wizards themselves. The worgen sieged the keep of the noble, Baron Silverlaine. Situated above the tiny hamlet of Pyrewood, the keep quickly fell into shadow and ruin.
